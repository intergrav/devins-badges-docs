            <h1>🏅 About</h1>
<p>This is Devin's Badges! A project I work on in my spare time that contains cool badges for you to use in your projects.</p>
<p>I aim to be as consistent as possible with these. I also try to make these look great on most modern sites.</p>
<h2>📰 Using in your project</h2>
<p>Want to add these badges to your page? Head over to the <a href="./badges">badge reference</a> to find the badges most fitting for your use, and how to use them. You can then copy the HTML code, which I recommend for best customizability, or the Markdown code for your chosen badge, and paste that into your file.</p>
<h2>➕ Adding more badges</h2>
<p>Want to add your own badge ideas to the project? Feel free to open up an issue and I'll make one!</p>
<p>You can make badges for your own personal use aswell if I am not available; it's pretty easy to make the badges as long as you know a bit of Figma.</p>
<h2>⭐ Enjoy this project?</h2>
<p>Please star the GitHub repository if you enjoy this project!</p>
<h2>❗ Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This is currently a work in progress, I only have a few badges for a few services right now. However, I am planning to have a lot more badges in the coming weeks.</p>
